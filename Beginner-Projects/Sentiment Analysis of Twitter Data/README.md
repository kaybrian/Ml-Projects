There are many Twitter sentiment analysis datasets available on Kaggle. One of the most popular datasets is called sentiment140, which contains 1.6 million pre-processed Tweets. This is a great dataset to start with if you are new to sentiment analysis.

These Tweets have been annotated, and the target variable is the sentiment. The unique values in this column are 0 (negative), 2 (neutral), and 4 (positive).

After pre-processing these Tweets and converting them into vectors, you can use a classification model to train them with their associated sentiment. You can use algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree classifier, or XGBoost classifier for this task.

Another alternative is to use a deep learning model like LSTM to come up with sentiment prediction. However, this is a slightly more challenging approach and falls into the advanced project category.

You can also use this labeled dataset as a base for future sentiment analysis tasks.

If you have any Tweets you want to collect and perform sentiment analysis on, you can use a model that has been previously trained on sentiment140 to make future predictions.
