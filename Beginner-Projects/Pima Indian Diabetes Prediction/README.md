The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

Based on variables like BMI, age, and insulin, the model will predict diabetes in patients. This dataset has nine variables — eight independent variables and one target variable.

The target variable is ‘diabetes’, so you will predict 1 for the presence of diabetes or 0 for the absence of diabetes.

This is a classification problem to experiment with models like logistic regression, decision tree classifier, or random forest classifier.

All the independent variables in this dataset are numeric, so this is a great dataset to start with if you have minimal feature engineering experience.

This is a Kaggle dataset open to beginners. There are many tutorials online that walk you through coding the solution in Python and R. These notebook tutorials are a great way to learn and get your hands dirty so you can move on to more complex projects.
