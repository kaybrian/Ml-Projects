The customer segmentation dataset on Kaggle is a great way to get started with unsupervised machine learning. This dataset consists of customer details like their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

You need to use these variables to build customer segments. Customers who are alike should be grouped into similar clusters. You can use algorithms like K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering for this task. Customer segmentation models can provide business value.

Companies often want to segregate their customers to come up with different marketing techniques for each customer type.

The main goals of this dataset include:
    - Achieving customer segmentation using machine learning techniques
    - Identify your target customers for different marketing strategies
    - Understand how marketing strategies work in the real world

Building a clustering model for this task can help your portfolio stand out, and segmentation is a great skill to have if you are looking to get an AI-related job in the marketing industry.
