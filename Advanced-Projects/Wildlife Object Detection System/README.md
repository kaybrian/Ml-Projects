If you live in an area with frequent wild-animal sightings, it is helpful to implement an object detection system to identify their presence in your area. Follow these steps to build a system like this -

    - Install cameras in the area you want to monitor.
    - Download all video footage and save them.
    - Create a Python application to analyze incoming images and identify wild animals.

Microsoft has built an Image Recognition API using data collected from wildlife cameras. They released an open-source pre-trained model for this purpose called a MegaDetector.

You can use this pre-trained model in your Python application to identify wild animals from the images collected. It is one of the most exciting ML projects mentioned so far and is pretty simple to implement due to the availability of a pre-trained model for this purpose.
